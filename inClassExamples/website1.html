        <p id="para1">Hello, My Name is Nicole. Welcome to my site!</p>
        <p>This is a site for my JavaScript Class</p>
        <p>I wasn't sure if the CSS would actually work on this website, so I am now practicing
             to see if it will show up. </br>
             I am ready to learn more HTML and CSS so that I can make decorative and detailed webpage.
